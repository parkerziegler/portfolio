# NAME: AWR_Script
# Description: Run an areal-weighted reaggregation (AWR) on crime data and racial Census data for the city of Chicago given a .csv file of crimes, a shapefile for Census block groups, and a shapefile for CPD police beats.
# Author: Parker Ziegler
# Preparatory Steps
# Create a .mxd file to hold your map (i.e. "Chicago_Arrest_Map.mxd")
# Create a .csv file of the point data you're interested in. In this case, I used data showing the locations of arrests for crack cocaine possession in Chicago, courtesy of the Chicago Data Portal.
# You'll need to acquire shapefiles of the City of Chicago police beats as well as Census data. These can be accessed via the Chicago Data Portal and census.gov, respectively.
# Place all files and their metadata into your workspace folder.
# Import system modules.
import arcpy
import os
# Set environment workspace, enable file overwrite.
from arcpy import env

# Create a file geodatabase to store your data

arcpy.CreateFileGDB_management(out_folder_path, out_name)

# Before starting analysis, we need to clean up our Census layer. In order to run the SelectLayerByLocation tool we first have to create a layer file from our Census shapefile.

# Perform a select by location on the Census data to get only the blocks groups that intersect the CPD police beats.

# Write these block groups to a new shapefile.

# The script is now complete. The final map should be composed of two layers â€“ "arrest_density" (a choropleth density of arrests for possession of crack cocaine) and "race_by_beats" (a dot density representation of the racial make up of Chicago). You may also want to add a base map depending on your purposes.
# Use the symbology GUI to change the symbology and set boundaries as you wish. I recommend doing most of your design work in Adobe Illustrator.
