          density of crashes and local measures of poverty. The results of this

          of traffic crashes tend to have higher poverty rates, lower median
          incomes, and be more densely populated.

        forest. The first â€“ a result of high resolution change detection
        analysis using a combination of LiDAR and NAIP multispectral imagery â€“
        visualizes how Portland&apos;s urban forest has evolved at multiple
        geographic and temporal scales. The second â€“ a result of geographically
        weighted regression â€“ attempts to pinpoint some of the main drivers and
        correlates of canopy distribution, including race, education, home
        ownership, and population density. Maps were generated using ArcGIS,
        graphics were generated using the R statistical programming language,

        This layout, made as part of Middlebury College&apos;s 2016 Cartographic
        Design seminar, brings together several advanced cartographic techniques
        to tell a unique story about the indigenous communities of the southern
        Peruvian Andes. Working in collaboration with the Andean Alliance for
        Sustainable Development (AASD), I designed this layout to discuss the
        challenges these communities face with respect to agriculture and social
        service access. I also sought to highlight some of the ways AASD is
        helping local farmers to integrate their indigenous knowledge with high
        altitude growing practices to create a more stable agricultural system
        in the region.

        The shaded relief I created for this layout draws inspiration from the

          Tom Patterson
