        orange lines representing the number of child migrants attempting to
        cross the border and red lines representing the number of U.S. Customs
        and Border Protection (CBP) staff. The second map zooms in to the border
        crossing at the Rio Grande Valley, where 73% of apprehended child
        migrants attempted the passage. The third map shows the actual migration
        paths these children take from their homes in Central America to reach
        the border. The graphics help to illustrate where these child migrants
        are coming from, as well as the fluctuations in migration patterns from
        2013 to 2015.

        My hope with this layout is to tell a compelling, honest story about the
        child refugees on our doorstep. In attempting to do so, I also
        acknowledge the incompleteness of this story, and the many ways in which
        this layout fails to represent the lived experiences of the many
        children who attempt this dangerous journey. These maps are dedicated to

        to tell a unique story about the indigenous communities of the southern

        of Big Tech began in the early 2010s, low-income residents have
        increasingly been priced out and pushed out of their homes. In
        particular, neighborhoods like the Mission, the Sunset, the Castro, and
        the Haight-Ashbury have seen rapid and violent change, with extreme
        increases in home value prices and monthly rent. The Ellis Act, a piece
        of legislation giving businesses the unrestricted right to evict tenants
        in order to &ldquo;go out of business,&rdquo; has given way to an
        arbitrary and aggressive regime of real estate speculation backed by big
        capital. For more information on San Francisco&apos;s eviction epidemic,

        This map, which takes its cue from{' '}
        <InlineLink href="http://radicalcartography.net/index.html?chicagodots">
          Bill Rankin&apos;s dot density map of Chicago
        </InlineLink>
        , takes a look at the spatial relationship between race and arrest
        density for possession of three different drugs â€“ marijuana, powder
        cocaine, and crack cocaine â€“ in Chicago, Illinois. Similar to
        Rankin&apos;s map, I used a dot density style to show the racial
        segregation of the city; however, I altered the value of each dot to
        represent 250 people, rather than the 25 people per dot value used by
        Rankin. This allowed the choropleth layer underneath to come through.
        <br />
        <br />
        The choropleth layer represents an arrest density for possession of the
        highlighted drug for the month of October 2015, as reported by the
        Chicago Police Department. I spatially aggregated the crime data by the
        Chicago Police Department&apos;s police beats using a method known as{' '}
        <InlineLink href="/thoughts/creating-custom-geoprocessing-tools-with-python-scripts">
          areal weighted reaggregation (AWR)
        </InlineLink>
        . This allows us to see the police beats in which arrests for possession
        of these different drugs are particularly high. The South and West Side
        appear to experience the most aggressive policing for possession of
        marijuana and crack cocaine, while transitional border areas between
        Latino and white communities are more heavy policed for powder cocaine
        possession. In general, it is startling to see how closely higher
        policing rates are spatially correlated with communities of color.
        Indeed, the data provide convincing evidence that racial profiling still
        informs how the state thinks about drugs, policing, and whose behavior
        is considered &ldquo;criminal&rdquo;.

        <br />I believe it is important to give credit where credit is due, and
        I want to recognize Professor Jeff Howarth for developing the original
        GIS workflow to make this map. Following his lead, I made several
        alterations and decisions of my own (with respect to normalization,
        symbology, drugs studied, cartographic design, and operation parameters)
        to make these maps uniquely my own. To get the data and begin mapping
